    - We craft our own cables and test them using a multi-step process.

  - Network infrastructure built fully using on IPv6.
    - We actively contribute to the adoption of the IPv6 protocol.
      - Customers are urged to use it whenever possible.
        - In the future, we'd like to introduce a program giving customers huge perks if using IPv6 only.
