## Company 💼
**Hypefox Ltd**  
Hypefox Studios

We are an IT startup with the following as our main priorities:
- Privacy & security 🔒
  - Added security with [CrowdSec](https://www.crowdsec.net/); contributing to threat intelligence and helping build a safer internet.
  - Enforcing RPKI & IRR for enhanced BGP security, which creates a more secure and robust network.
  - Latest security tech, like TLS 1.3, QUIC (HTTP/3), DNSSEC, HSTS, modern DDoS mitigation & WAF.
  - Authentication using physical [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) keys; self-destruct if 3 failed PIN attempts.
  - We always keep the software we run up-to-date.
  - Strong measures to protect customer data.
  - Automatic kernel patching on our servers.
  - Detailed logging of staff activity.
- Networking 🌍
  - Only use Ethernet cables with CAT6 or higher.
    - We craft our own cables and test them using a multi-step process.
      - Shielded connectors and cable stress dampeners.
  - Network infrastructure built fully with IPv6.
    - We actively contribute to the adoption of the IPv6 protocol.
      - Customers are urged to use it whenever possible.
        - In the future, we'd like to introduce a program giving customers huge perks if using IPv6 only.
          - We will also provide guides on how to keep backwards compatibility with IPv4, for example by properly implementing Cloudflare into the stack.
